	abstract = {The web is an incredible platform. Its mix of ubiquity across devices and operating systems, its user-centered security model, and the fact that neither its specification nor its implementation are controlled by a single company makes the web a unique platform to develop software on. Combined with its inherent linkability, it's possible to search it and share what you've found with anyone, anywhere. Whenever you go to a website, it's up-to-date, and your experience with that site can be as ephemeral or as permanent as you'd like. Web applications can reach anyone, anywhere, on any device with a single codebase.},
